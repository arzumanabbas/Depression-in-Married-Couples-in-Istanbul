## About Data
The data has been collected in Ä°stanbul via an online form. It is aimed to examine the depression scores of married people and the influence of demographic factors.
Demographic Questions and Beck Depression Inventory is used to collect data. Total Score of Scale must be calculated by the sum of items B1-B21. Codes reflecting the categories of demographic questions are as below.

- **Gender :** 1-Female, 2-Male; 

- **Education :** 1-Primary, 2-High School, 3-Bachelor, 4-Msc or PhD; 

- **Working Status :** 1-Employed, 2-Unemployed;

## Beck's Depression Inventory
The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), created by Aaron T. Beck, is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory, one of the most widely used psychometric tests for measuring the severity of depression. Its development marked a shift among mental health professionals, who had until then, viewed depression from a psychodynamic perspective, instead of it being rooted in the patient's own thoughts.

> Each of the 21 questions are 4 optioned questions having score from 0 to 3. Minimum score being 0 and maximum being 63.The  degree of depression is directly proportional to the BDI score

### Some of the questions are :

### 1.
- ***0** I do not feel sad*
- ***1** I feel sad*
- ***2** I am sad all the time and I can't snap out of it.*
- ***3** I am so sad and unhappy that I can't stand it.*

### 2.

- ***0** I am not particularly discouraged about the future.*
- ***1** I feel discouraged about the future.*
- ***2** I feel I have nothing to look forward to.*
- ***3** I feel the future is hopeless and that things cannot improve.*

## BDI Score
> Based on the BDI score, the patient is categorised as follows :

- **Below 10 :** These ups and downs are considered normal
- **11-16 :** Mild mood disturbance
- **17-20 :** Borderline clinical depression
- **21-30 :** Moderate depression
- **31-40 :** Severe depression
- **Over 40 :** Extreme depression


And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

## Analyzing Dataset

> We see that women have a higher average rate of marital depression than men.

> It is clear that unemployed people experience less marital depression than employed people.

 > Increasing people's level of education leads to psychologically healthier family life. 
 In short, education brings peace.

 > Individuals in families with children experience less marital depression on average. 
 We will examine this topic separately for genders in the future

 > Marital style may not appear to affect marital depression at first glance, 
 but when we examine it, we will see both negative and positive effects of 
 this topic depending on gender.

## Analyzing by Genders

 And it is not depend on any gender

 > Average depression threshold is higher in arranged marriages, 
 but relatively lower in flirtatious marriages.
 Especially for women psychology arranged marriages are really dangerous

 > Education has a positive effect on both sexes, but in women, the average level of marital depression 
 decreases with the increase in the level of education.

 > Towards the end, we make an interesting discovery :) 
 So, although the presence of children at home does not affect men as much, 
 the feeling of being a mother causes a decrease in the level of depression in women. 
 Simply put, children heal their mothers.
